# SEIR_model_extension

## Model Selection:

- Base model: SEIR model and other variants
- Extension: Introduce new compartments: Quarantine/Vaccination & risk averse human behaviour

## Showcase:

1. Montecarlo simulation: Simulate larger version and focus on more types and non-rational agents
2. Game Theory: In a game form, two different kind of agents that follow the rules
3. Heuristics: For larger game, use heuristic to search for nash equilibria
